However even the basic Replicator is $2,200 - _way_ too expensive for most hobbyists to justify purchasing. That's why we have hacker spaces with communal machines. We think they're awesome, but a little inconvenient and inaccessible.\r\n\r\n## ThingSmith for Makers\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to print out a 3D companion cube as an awesome gift. Just post your model on ThingSmith and specify a desired cost, material and completion date. Then, wait and watch as potential producers bid for your business. Once you've found a satisfactory producer, just accept their bid and wait for your epic creation to arrive.\r\n\r\nIt's as simple as that.\r\n\r\n## ThingSmith for Producers\r\n\r\nModerns fabrication equipment is expensive. However with ThingSmith it can pay for itself.\r\n"}
