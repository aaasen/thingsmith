          <h1>ThingSmith</h1>

<p>ThingSmith connects makers with great ideas to people who have the 3D printers and laser cutters necessary to make their ideas a reality.</p>

<h2>Why ThingSmith?</h2>

<p>With tools like Makerbot's Replicator 2, desktop 3D printing is slowly creeping into the mainstream. However even the basic Replicator is $2,200 - <em>way</em> too expensive for most hobbyists to justify purchasing. That's why we have hacker spaces with communal machines. We think they're awesome, but a little inconvenient and inaccessible.</p>

<h2>ThingSmith for Makers</h2>

<p>Let's say you want to print out a 3D companion cube as an awesome gift. Just post your model on ThingSmith and specify a desired cost, material and completion date. Then, wait and watch as potential producers bid for your business. Once you've found a satisfactory producer, just accept their bid and wait for your epic creation to arrive.</p>

<p>It's as simple as that.</p>

<h2>ThingSmith for Producers</h2>

<p>Moderns fabrication equipment is expensive. However with ThingSmith it can pay for itself.</p>
